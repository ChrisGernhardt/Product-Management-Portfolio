      <strong>Role:</strong> Customer Experience & Operations (PM-adjacent responsibilities)<br>
      <strong>Timeline:</strong> 2019 ‚Äì 2021<br>
      <strong>Methods:</strong> Data Analysis ¬∑ Ticket Categorization ¬∑ Root Cause Identification ¬∑ Cross-Functional Collaboration ¬∑ Product Improvements
    </div>
    <h4>üîë Case Study Snapshot</h4>
    <div><strong>Type:</strong> Real-World SaaS Project (Doctolib)</div>
    <div><strong>Role:</strong> CX/Operations lead with product ownership responsibilities (problem discovery, backlog input, stakeholder collaboration).</div>
    <div><strong>Problem:</strong> Support tickets were increasing rapidly as Doctolib scaled. Many issues were recurring product gaps rather than one-off user problems. This slowed down support teams and hurt user satisfaction.</div>
    <div><strong>Objective:</strong> Identify product-related causes of ticket volume and collaborate with Product & Engineering to implement improvements that would reduce ticket load.</div>
    <div><strong>Approach:</strong> Analyzed ticket data ‚Üí identified recurring product gaps ‚Üí framed problem statements ‚Üí partnered with Product/Engineering to prioritize fixes.</div>
    <div><strong>Outcome:</strong> üßæ Reduced ticket volume by ~30% ¬∑ ‚ö° Freed up support capacity ¬∑ üòä Improved user experience at scale.</div>
    <h5>The Problem</h5>
    <div>As Doctolib expanded across new markets, support operations struggled with:<br>
    Growing ticket volumes that scaled faster than team size.<br>
    High proportion of tickets caused by <strong>recurring product gaps</strong>.<br>
    Support agents forced into manual workarounds ‚Üí slower resolution times.<br>
    <strong>Business risk:</strong> Without fixing upstream issues, support costs would keep rising and user trust could erode.</div>
    <h5>Objective</h5>
    <div class="icon-list">
      <span>üõ†Ô∏è Reduce ticket volume by addressing root product issues.</span>
      <span>‚ö° Improve efficiency of support teams.</span>
      <span>üí° Deliver a smoother user experience, reducing frustration.</span>
    </div>
    <h5>Research & Insights</h5>
    <div><strong>Ticket Analysis:</strong> Categorized thousands of tickets by theme and frequency.<br>
    <strong>Patterns Identified:</strong> A small set of recurring product gaps caused a large portion of total tickets.<br>
    <strong>Support Feedback:</strong> Agents confirmed that many requests could be avoided with small product fixes.<br>
    <strong>Business Alignment:</strong> Demonstrated cost savings potential by reducing repeat tickets.</div>
    <h5>Key Insight</h5>
    <div>Improving <strong>specific product flows</strong> would cut significant ticket volume and improve user satisfaction ‚Äî much more efficient than adding more support staff.</div>
    <h5>Solution: Product Improvements</h5>
    <div>Partnered with Product & Engineering to scope targeted fixes.<br>
    Prioritized high-impact areas (top recurring issues).<br>
    Ensured improvements were lightweight and feasible within delivery timelines.<br>
    Set clear success criteria (ticket reduction, faster resolution, positive feedback).</div>
    <h5>Prioritization</h5>
    <div>Must: Fix top 2 recurring product gaps causing highest ticket volume.<br>
    Should: Simplify flows that agents flagged as confusing.<br>
    Could: Explore automation for lower-priority issues.<br>
    Won‚Äôt (v1): Build entirely new tooling ‚Äî focus on small impactful fixes.</div>
    <h5>Outcome</h5>
    <ul class="success-list">
      <li>üßæ Ticket volume reduced by ~30% in targeted categories.</li>
      <li>‚ö° Support team freed to focus on complex cases instead of repetitive tickets.</li>
      <li>üòä Improved user experience, reflected in fewer complaints and faster resolutions.</li>
      <li>üí° Built stronger collaboration loop between Support, Product, and Engineering.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Results & Learnings</h5>
    <ul class="results-list">
      <li>‚úÖ Showed how <strong>data-driven insights from CX</strong> can drive product impact.</li>
      <li>‚úÖ Reinforced importance of <strong>closing the loop between operations and product</strong>.</li>
      <li>‚úÖ Demonstrated measurable results (ticket reduction + happier users).</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="key-learning">Key Learning: Support data is a goldmine for product decisions ‚Äî when structured and analyzed, it reveals hidden inefficiencies that can be solved at scale through product improvements.</div>
